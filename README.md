# jeremy-bot
Put a replacement for you in your discord channel!  
  
For this project, you will need to install FFmpeg(https://ffmpeg.org/) and will have to install slappey(https://www.npmjs.com/package/slappey) globally.  
1. Clone this repo, but don't work off of it.
2. Do a normal setup for a discord bot on discord.com/developers (give it admin permissions).
3. Use slappey to create a new discord bot setup.
4. Copy the voice folder over from src/commands.
5. Copy the VoiceLoopCommand.js file from src/utils/structures.  
  
Should work afterwards. You can then follow the pattern in src/commands/voice to get the bot to start working.
