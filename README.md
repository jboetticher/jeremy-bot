# jeremy-bot
Put a replacement for you in your discord channel.  
You will need to install FFmpeg(https://ffmpeg.org/) and will have to install slappy(https://www.npmjs.com/package/slappey) globally.  
Do a normal setup for a discord bot (give it admin permissions). Use slappey to configure this project so that it points to your bot, not mine.  
Then you can follow the pattern in src/commands/voice to get the bot to start working.
